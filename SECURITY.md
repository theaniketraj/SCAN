| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the SCAN Gradle Plugin seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **<>**

If you prefer, you can also report vulnerabilities through our private security contact form at: [Contact Form Link]

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What kind of impact the vulnerability might have
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of the plugin are affected
- **Environment**: Details about your environment (Gradle version, OS, etc.)
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: We will provide a detailed response within 7 days indicating next steps
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure

### Security Update Process

When a security vulnerability is confirmed:

1. **Patch Development**: We develop and test a fix
2. **Security Advisory**: We prepare a security advisory
3. **Release**: We release patched versions for all supported releases
4. **Notification**: We notify users through:
   - GitHub Security Advisories
   - Release notes
   - Project documentation updates
   - Community channels (if applicable)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Plugin Configuration

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
- **Secure Configuration**: Review your scan configuration files for sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to scan reports and configuration files
- **CI/CD Security**: Ensure your CI/CD pipelines handle scan results securely

### Pattern Files

- **Version Control**: Be careful not to commit actual secrets in custom pattern files
- **Testing**: Use placeholder values when testing custom patterns
- **Distribution**: Avoid sharing pattern files that might contain sensitive regex patterns

### Report Handling

- **Storage**: Store scan reports securely and limit access
- **Transmission**: Use secure channels when sharing scan results
- **Retention**: Implement appropriate retention policies for scan reports
- **Redaction**: Consider redacting sensitive parts of reports when sharing

## Known Security Considerations

### Plugin Scope

- The plugin scans files in your project directory structure
- Scan results may contain sensitive information fragments
- The plugin does not transmit data externally by default

### Dependencies

- We regularly audit our dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Security updates for dependencies are prioritized
- We maintain a minimal dependency footprint

### File Access

- The plugin requires read access to your project files
- Scan configuration files should be protected appropriately
- Generated reports may contain sensitive data snippets

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **Entropy-based Detection**: Identifies high-entropy strings that may be secrets
- **Context-aware Scanning**: Reduces false positives by understanding code context
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Allows tuning detection sensitivity
- **Whitelist Support**: Enables exclusion of known safe patterns

### Privacy Considerations

- **Local Processing**: All scanning happens locally on your machine
- **No Data Transmission**: The plugin doesn't send data to external servers
- **Configurable Output**: You control what information appears in reports

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Initial reports should be made privately
2. **Investigation Period**: We investigate and develop fixes privately
3. **Coordinated Release**: We coordinate public disclosure with reporters
4. **Credit**: We provide appropriate credit to security researchers

### Public Disclosure Timeline

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 90 days maximum from initial report
- **High Severity**: 120 days maximum from initial report
- **Medium/Low Severity**: 180 days maximum from initial report

Earlier disclosure may occur if:

- A fix is available and deployed
- The vulnerability becomes publicly known
- The reporter agrees to earlier disclosure

## Contact Information

- **Security Email**: <>
- **GPG Key**: [Public GPG Key for encrypted communications]
